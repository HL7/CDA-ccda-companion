This package supports QA of the C-CDA companion guide. HL7 will post this copy to GitHub to maintain record of changes. A future pre-publication will be posted with all changes accepted.

Due to the limited scope of this unballoted STU update instead of a redline version of the guide we are instead providing a document that contains only the in scope section where changes were done, as well as information on the terminology changes in VSAC to accompany this STU update
