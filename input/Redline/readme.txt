This package supports QA of the C-CDA companion guide. HL7 will post this copy to GitHub to maintain record of changes. A future pre-publication will be posted with all changes accepted.

Due to the limited scope of this unballoted STU update instead of a redline version of the guide we are instead providing a document that contains only the in scope section where changes were done, as well as information on the terminology changes in VSAC to accompany this STU update

To see all JIRA trackers applied used filter: https://jira.hl7.org/issues/?filter=20320

The redline file for the previous version of the C-CDA companion guide is also included.  It is not up to date with the changes added in 4.1 which are captured in the aforementioned redline version.
